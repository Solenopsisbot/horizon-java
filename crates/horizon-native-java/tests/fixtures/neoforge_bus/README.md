# NeoForge event-bus fixture

`mod/demo/` registers listeners on NeoForge's buses in every `IEventBus#addListener` overload; each
listener prints its name when it runs. `neoforge_bus_tests.rs` compiles it with `javac` against
compile-only stubs (`bus-stubs/`, with bus-8.0.5's signatures, and `events/`), puts only `demo/*` in
the jar, runs it in the runtime and fires the events through the game's dispatch.

`oracle.jsonl` is the same fixture on the real bus: `oracle/BusOracle.java` compiled against the real
jars instead of `bus-stubs/` (so the fixture's call sites are bus-8.0.5's own descriptors), on
OpenJDK 25.0.5+8 (the Java 26.3 runs mods on). Its game bus is NeoForge 26.3.0.101's own
`NeoForge.EVENT_BUS`; a mod bus is built as `FMLModContainer.<init>` @31–62 builds it. `events/`
stands in for NeoForge's event classes (same names, hierarchy, abstractness, `ICancellableEvent` and
`IModBusEvent`), which cannot load without the game.

Regenerate (jars from a NeoForge 26.3.0.101 install's `libraries/`: `net/neoforged/bus/8.0.5`,
`net/neoforged/fancymodloader/loader/12.0.12`, `net/neoforged/neoforge/26.3.0.101` (universal),
`net/jodah/typetools/0.6.3`, `org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-api/2.26.0`, `org/ow2/asm/asm/9.11`):
