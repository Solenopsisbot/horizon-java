//! The watch service's objects as host handles (#156 P2): the
//! `StandardWatchEventKinds` constants, and the services, keys and events
//! `watch_service.rs` hands out. Their text forms (`watch-kind/…`,
//! `watch-service/<n>`, `watch-key/<n>`, `watch-event/<n>`) were Strings a
//! jar could spell; `"" + "watch-kind/ENTRY_CREATE"` printed `ENTRY_CREATE`.
//!
//! * a kind's key is its name; there is one object per constant
//!   (canonical), and `toString` is the name (`StdWatchEventKind`);
//! * a service, key or event's key is the number the model minted for it,
//!   one per object, so equal keys are the same object (canonical). None of
//!   their classes overrides `toString`/`hashCode`: identity, counted. Their
//!   state lives in the run's `WatchState`, so they do not cross to another
//!   jar's runtime.
//!
//! Classes are JDK 25's on Linux (`LinuxWatchService`), checked against a
//! Java 25 run (`tests/fixture_host_values_p2.rs`).
