//! NeoForge data attachments on players, bridged onto the game's attachment store
//! (`docs/attachments-design.md`, slice 1).
//!
//! # What runs here
//!
//! * **Types.** `AttachmentType.builder(Supplier|Function)` and the builder's `serialize`,
//!   `copyOnDeath`, `copyHandler`, `sync` and `build`, with the checks and messages of
//!   `AttachmentType$Builder` in `neoforge-26.3.0.101-universal.jar` (`serialize` @9–21 "Serializer
//!   already set", `copyOnDeath` @1–16 "copyOnDeath requires a serializer", `copyHandler` @5–21
//!   "copyHandler requires a serializer", `requireNonNull` on every handler).
//! * **Registration.** `DeferredRegister.create(NeoForgeRegistries.ATTACHMENT_TYPES, ns)` names the
//!   registry `neoforge:attachment_types` (the bytecode's key; the runtime used to say
//!   `attachment_type`). `register(name, Supplier)` keeps its supplier, and
//!   [`NativeJar::register_attachment_types`] runs them at NeoForge's moment, the `RegisterEvent`
//!   for that registry: after every entrypoint stage, in registration order, only for registers
//!   whose `register(IEventBus)` ran. Before that a `DeferredHolder.get()` is NeoForge's
//!   `NullPointerException("Trying to access unbound value: ResourceKey[neoforge:attachment_types /
//!   ns:path]")` (`DeferredHolder.value` @0–31).
//! * **Holder calls on a player**, both overloads of `getData`, `setData`, `hasData`,
//!   `getExistingData`, `getExistingDataOrNull`, `removeData` and `syncData`, as
//!   `AttachmentHolder` and `IAttachmentHolder` do them: `getData` makes and keeps the default and
//!   answers the live object; `setData` rejects null (`requireNonNull` @5) and answers the previous
//!   value; `removeData` answers null without a sync when the holder's map was never made.
//! * **Saving** is the game's: each value is stored in the game's store by its registered id
//!   (`<ns>`/`<path>`), with the bytes the mod's own codec writes, run here
//!   ([`crate::attachment_codec`]). Only `serialize(MapCodec[, Predicate])` over carryon's three
//!   codec nodes runs; every other serializer is a counted refusal.
//!
//! # The bridge: a snapshot in, a journal out
//!
//! The runtime never holds the game's host. Before a batch of Java calls in a hook that has a
//! `ServerHost`, the mod hands the jar's host a snapshot of each online player's store entries for
//! the jar's types ([`StdHost::open_attachment_batch`]): absent, one of ours (by token), or a saved
//! compound not decoded yet. Holder calls read and update that view, and every store change is
//! journalled; after the batch the mod applies the journal to the game's store
//! ([`StdHost::close_attachment_batch`]). Nothing else runs on the server thread between the two,
//! so the view is the store. A hook without a `ServerHost` opens no batch, and holder calls there
//! stay the counted unknowns they were.
//!
//! # Departures from NeoForge, named
//!
//! * **D1** the saved envelope is the game's `horizon:attachments.<ns>.<path>.value`, not
//!   `neoforge:attachments.<ns:path>`; the per-type compound inside is the same bytes.
//! * **D2** saved data of a removed jar is kept by the game's store, where NeoForge drops it.
//! * **D3** a saved value decodes at first access, plus an eager pass when the player joins
//!   ([`NativeJar::attachment_player_joined`]), not inside `Entity#load`.
//! * **D4** the R1 cadence: every live value is re-encoded after each batch
//!   ([`NativeJar::attachment_batch_end`]), not once per save. Exact for a pure serializer.
//! * **D5** sync is not sent: every point NeoForge would enter `AttachmentSync` for a synced type is
//!   counted as the unknown `neoforge:sync_attachments (not sent)`, and values are stored with
//!   `sync: false`.
//! * **D6** an End return round-trips each value through its codec at `player_clone`, after the
//!   game kept the map, instead of inside `restoreFrom`.
//!
//! Also named (the PR lists them): a codec failure at save stores the empty child `{}` NeoForge's
//! output keeps (`TagValueOutput.child` puts it before `write` runs; the design table said "left
//! out"); a failure during an End-return or death copy, where NeoForge throws out of the respawn,
//! drops that value instead; a value whose batch made an unmodelled host call is *tainted* and its
//! last exact bytes stay stored, so taint follows the objects that were live during the call, not
//! data a later clean batch copies out of them.
