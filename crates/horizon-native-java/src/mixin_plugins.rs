//! Mixin config plugins (`IMixinConfigPlugin`), run the way Mixin runs them.
//!
//! A Mixin config may name a plugin class that decides, in its own code,
//! which of the config's Mixins apply to which targets. The load-time weave
//! never runs that code, so it refuses every plan such a config governs
//! (`config-plugin`). The game-hook tier asks the plugin instead, and this
//! module is how: one **session** per config, with one plugin instance kept
//! on a resident heap for the whole session, in the order Mixin 0.8.7's
//! `MixinConfig`/`MixinProcessor` calls it (read from its bytecode):
//!
//! 1. the no-argument constructor (`getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()`);
//! 2. `onLoad(mixinPackage)`, with the config's `package` as written (Mixin
//!    appends its trailing `.` only after this call);
//! 3. `getRefMapperConfig()`, whose answer is recorded and otherwise unused:
//!    the tier binds by official names, so there is no refmap to swap;
//! 4. `shouldApplyMixin(targetClassName, mixinClassName)` for every Mixin the
//!    config lists on this side (common list first, then the side's list) and
//!    every target its `@Mixin` names, binary names with dots;
//! 5. `acceptTargets(myTargets, otherTargets)`: the targets this config kept,
//!    and the targets of the jar's other configs (a real pack would add every
//!    other mod's; a plugin only reads them);
//! 6. `getMixins()`: companion Mixins, named relative to the package. Mixin
//!    applies those without asking `shouldApplyMixin`, on every side.
//!
//! Then, for each `(mixin, target)` the plugin kept, `preApply` and
//! `postApply` run once with a stand-in `ClassNode` and `IMixinInfo`. Mixin
//! calls them around the bytecode it applies; the hook tier applies none, so
//! a plugin that only logs or checks names there passes, and one that reads
//! or edits the node stops at the node's first member, which names it.
//!
//! **The bound.** Every call runs on a strict host (an unmodelled host call
//! fails instead of answering a neutral value) under its own 250 ms budget.
//! A failure in steps 1–3, 5 or 6 refuses the whole config with the step and
//! the member it stopped at; a failure in one `shouldApplyMixin` (or its
//! `preApply`/`postApply`) refuses that Mixin only, and the session goes on,
//! keeping what the failed call wrote before it stopped, as a JVM keeps what
//! a thrown call wrote. A refused plan keeps `config-plugin`; the refusal text
//! is in [`ConfigPluginReport`], so nothing is ever applied on a guess.
//!
//! **The platform the plugin sees** is the jar's own, alone: the host is
//! [`NativeJar::seed_host`]'s (its mod id and declared dependencies loaded,
//! its resources and services) with the side's environment type, Fabric's
//! loader and API classes present for a Fabric jar and absent otherwise
//! (`ClassNotFoundException`, which is what a platform probe catches), and
//! NeoForge's and Forge's absent on a Fabric server. A plugin that applies a
//! compat Mixin only when another mod is loaded therefore declines it, as it
//! would with that mod absent. The plugin's static state lives only for the
//! planning sessions of this jar; the entrypoint host starts from its own.
