//! Host objects as typed handles: `Value::Host(HostRef { kind, key })` (#156).
//!
//! The runtime used to name every host object with text (`optional/…`,
//! `identifier/…`, `list/…`), the same `Value::Ref` a Java `String` is, so a
//! jar string spelled like a marker was that object to every reader that
//! checked the prefix. A [`HostRef`] is a separate `Value` kind: nothing a
//! jar spells can be one.
//!
//! A handle is its family ([`HostKind`]) and the family's identity text
//! (`key`). Everything else about the object is a property of the kind's row
//! in the kind table ([`KINDS`]), read through the handle:
//!
//! * **class**: [`HostRef::class`], from the row's [`ClassRule`]: one fixed
//!   class (`java/util/Optional`), or, for a family (jar objects, collections,
//!   game objects), a function of the key; or not known at all (a lambda the
//!   model stands for), when only the types the object surely is are known
//!   ([`ClassRule::Unknown`]): then `getClass()` and every answer that needs
//!   the exact class are counted, never answered with a declared type;
//! * **identity**: [`HostRef::canonical`], the row's predicate on the key
//!   (below);
//! * **`toString`/`hashCode`/`equals`/`instanceof`**: the row's [`Methods`].
//!   They are the only place a kind's object methods live; the runtime
//!   (`object_methods.rs`, `jar_text.rs`) and the host (`StdHost`) both call
//!   them, each passing a [`Nested`] that answers for the values a handle
//!   holds: the runtime's runs a held jar object's own `hashCode`/`equals`/
//!   `toString` through the interpreter, the host's (which cannot run jar
//!   code) answers `None` for one, and the caller counts it;
//! * **casts**: `checkcast` and `instanceof` read [`HostRef::instance_of`],
//!   so `(String) Optional.empty()` throws Java's `ClassCastException`.
//!
//! # Keys
//!
//! A key is plain text, compared whole. It holds **one way**: two handles
//! with equal keys are equal objects (`equals` is `true`, `hashCode` agrees),
//! so a key is built from the canonical form of the kind's `equals` where the
//! kind can (an `OptionalDouble` keys `Double.doubleToLongBits`: every `NaN`
//! one key, `-0.0` not `0.0`). The converse does not hold: two equal objects
//! may have different keys when a held value is not canonical text (two
//! `List.of(1)` are two allocation markers; two jar objects equal by their
//! own `equals`). So a reader never treats different keys as "not equal":
//! `equals` is the row's method, which asks the held values. What does hold
//! both ways is identity: one object never gets two keys, so different keys
//! are different objects (`if_acmp`, [`HostRef::same_object`]).
//!
//! A key that holds values (an optional's value, a pair, a list's elements)
//! is built by [`HostRef::of_values`] and read by [`HostRef::values`], the one
//! encoder/decoder for nested values: each value's `value_marker`, joined
//! with `,`, separators escaped. A handle's own text form (in a collection, a
//! capture) is [`HostRef::encode`]/[`HostRef::decode`]; the list layer around
//! it (`value_marker`/`split_capture_markers`) escapes and unescapes it as it
//! does a string, so a key reads back byte for byte however deep it nests.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! A kind's canonical predicate says whether two handles with equal keys are
//! one object:
//!
//! * **canonical** (`true`): the JDK hands out one object per key (an enum
//!   constant, a `Class`, `Optional.empty()`): `==` is key equality, never
//!   counted;
//! * **not canonical** (`false`): equal keys are equal values but may be
//!   different objects (`Optional.of(5)` twice). An identity operation on two
//!   of them (`==`, `!=`, an `IdentityHashMap` key) is counted, unless the
//!   same handle provably flows to both sides, which the identity analysis
//!   decides (`reference_identity.rs`). Equal keys never answer identity.
//!
//! # Adding a kind (P1–P17)
//!
//! Add a [`HostKind`] variant and its row: a unique tag, the class rule, the
//! canonical predicate, and a `Methods` (the kind's module, like
//! `host_optional.rs`). Nothing else matches on kinds for object methods.
