//! Game events a jar subscribes to, named at registration and run later.
//!
//! A Fabric, NeoForge or Forge mod hooks the server by registering a listener
//! during its entrypoint: `ServerTickEvents.END_SERVER_TICK.register(...)`,
//! `NeoForge.EVENT_BUS.addListener(this::onTick)`, an `@EventBusSubscriber`
//! class, or Forge's per-event `ServerTickEvent.Post.BUS.addListener(...)`.
//! The interpreter records those calls as host invocations; this module turns
//! them into [`GameListener`]s with a stable identity ([`GameEvent`], the
//! loader, and the Fabric field or event class it came from) and runs one
//! listener when the game fires its event ([`NativeJar::run_game_listener`]).
//!
//! # The façade a listener sees
//!
//! A callback receives bounded markers, never live game objects: the server is
//! `game/server`, a level `game/level/<dimension>`, a player
//! `game/player/<uuid>`, a NeoForge/Forge event object `game-event/<event>`.
//! The game hands a snapshot ([`EventFacade`]) and the firing's context
//! ([`EventContext`]) to each firing, and the markers answer the few methods
//! callbacks call first (`getTickCount`, `getPlayerList().getPlayers()`,
//! `level.dimension()`, `player.getUUID()`, `event.getServer()`,
//! `setCanceled`...). Any other instance call on a façade marker fails the
//! listener with [`NativeError::UnknownHostCall`] naming that call: the caller
//! disables the listener and logs the reason once. A neutral `null`/`0` would
//! let the callback carry on with made-up state, which is worse than not
//! running it.
//!
//! # Results and cancellation
//!
//! [`EventFiring`] carries the firing's outcome across listeners (and across
//! jars, since each jar has its own host):
//!
//! - Fabric `boolean` callbacks (`ALLOW_DEATH`, `PlayerBlockBreakEvents.BEFORE`)
//!   stop at the first `false` and cancel, as Fabric's array-backed invoker does.
//! - Fabric `InteractionResult` callbacks (`UseBlockCallback`...) stop at the
//!   first result that is not `PASS`, which then replaces vanilla's handling.
//! - NeoForge/Forge listeners cancel with `setCanceled(true)` (or a Forge
//!   `Predicate` listener returning `true`); a later listener that did not ask
//!   for cancelled events (`receiveCanceled`) is skipped.
//!
//! # Order
//!
//! Listeners run in the loaders' own order ([`order`]): Fabric phases
//! (`register(phase, listener)`, `addPhaseOrdering`), NeoForge/Forge
//! `EventPriority`, then registration order, across every jar as one event.
