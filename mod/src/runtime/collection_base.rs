//! The JDK's abstract collection base bodies a jar class inherits.
//!
//! `invokeinterface Set.isEmpty` on an object whose class extends
//! `java.util.AbstractSet` resolves to `AbstractCollection.isEmpty`, whose
//! body is `size() == 0`. That class is a JDK class with no classfile here, so
//! the interface call used to fall through to the host's collection model,
//! which requires the receiver to be one of its own collection markers and
//! failed with "expected a native collection marker" — a hard error that cost
//! the whole listener (respackopts' `WeakSet.isEmpty`,
//! `docs/in-game-survey.md`, "Top causes" §5).
//!
//! Only the one member is answered, and only for a receiver that is an object
//! of a class the runtime holds (a jar or linked class) whose own `size()`
//! exists: `isEmpty` is then exactly `size() == 0`, as the JDK defines it.
//! Every other inherited base body, and every marker collection, keeps the
//! existing dispatch.
//!
//! Both call shapes reach here: `invokeinterface Set.isEmpty` on a receiver
//! typed as an interface (respackopts), and `invokevirtual Bag.isEmpty` on a
//! receiver typed as the jar subclass, which `javac` resolves to the inherited
//! `AbstractCollection.isEmpty` (same body).
