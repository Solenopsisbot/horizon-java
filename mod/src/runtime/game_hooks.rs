//! Game objects for the game-class hook tier.
//!
//! A `@Inject` callback the hook tier binds runs where a host hook point fires,
//! not inside a woven Minecraft class, so the object Mixin would hand it as
//! `this` (a `ServerPlayer`, a `LivingEntity`, the `MinecraftServer`) does not
//! exist in the interpreter. This module gives that object an identity and a
//! small, honest surface:
//!
//! - **Identity.** The host describes each object it passes as a
//!   [`GameObject`]: its vanilla class, entity id, UUID, name, position and the
//!   few other facts it already knows at the hook point. The interpreter sees a
//!   stable marker (`game/player/<uuid>`, `game/entity/<id>`, `game/server`),
//!   so the same entity is the same object at every firing.
//! - **Members.** A call on a marker answers from that description when the
//!   member is one this module models (`getUUID`, `getId`, `getX`,
//!   `getScoreboardName`, `level`, `getServer`...). Any other member, any
//!   `@Shadow` field of a Mixin class, and any other game-class call refuses
//!   with an error that names it. The callback stops there and the host decides
//!   what to do; nothing answers a neutral value the game never produced.
//! - **Mixin state.** Fields a Mixin class adds to its target (`shogi$cooldowns`)
//!   live in a [`GameHookState`] the host keeps per jar, keyed by the object's
//!   marker, so a value a callback stores on a player is there at the player's
//!   next tick. The Mixin class's no-argument constructor runs once per object,
//!   the first time a callback of that class sees it, which is where `javac`
//!   puts the field initialisers Mixin would merge into the target.
//!
//! The surface is deliberately small: it is what the bound callbacks of the
//! measured corpus reach first. Widening it is adding a row to
//! [`GameHookHost::answer`], never relaxing the refusal.
