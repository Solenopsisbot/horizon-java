//! What a registry marker iterates over.
//!
//! The host models a game registry as a `Registry` handle keyed by its id
//! (`host_registry.rs`), and records the entries a jar registers into it. A real `MappedRegistry.iterator()` yields
//! every value registered in that registry; the only entries this runtime has
//! values for are the ones the jar registered, so that is what the iterator
//! yields, in registration order.
//!
//! This is a deliberate bound, named here and in the PR: the game's own
//! entries (vanilla's ~140 entity types for `minecraft:entity_type`) are not
//! materialised, because the host has no `EntityType` objects to hand out and
//! inventing them would be worse than an empty iteration. A jar that walks a
//! registry to initialise its own per-type table therefore initialises nothing
//! for the game's types, while still seeing every entry it registered itself.
//! Before this, the call answered null, and `Iterator.hasNext` on it failed the
//! whole entrypoint (`entity-view-distance`'s `main`), which is what
//! `docs/in-game-survey.md` records.
